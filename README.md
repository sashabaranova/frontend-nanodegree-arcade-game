Classic arcade game recreated for my FEND project

## Description
Simple app for PC built using object-oriented programming and HTML canvas. 

The aim of the player is to reach water without hitting the enemies - bugs!
Use respective arrow keys to move the player up, down, to the left and to the right.

If the player and bug's paths cross, the player will return to his/her initial position.

If the player reaches the water, the gameboard is cleared off the bugs.
The game will then restart, the player will return to the initial position and new enemies will be generated.

Yes, it's a pretty infinite game so far:)

1. Press the green 'Clone or download' button in the right corner
